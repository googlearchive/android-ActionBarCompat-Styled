Android ActionBarCompat-Styled Sample
===================================

This sample shows you how to use ActionBarCompat with a customized theme. It utilizes a 
split action bar when running on a device with a narrow display, and shows three tabs.

Introduction
------------

This sample shows how to style an ActionBar using the [support library][1] on devices running 
Android v2.1+ using a custom theme.

This Activity extends from ActionBarActivity, which provides all of the function 
necessary to display a compatible Action Bar on devices running Android v2.1+.
A custom application theme and styles are defined in XML.

Assets have been generated using the ['Android Action Bar Style Generator'][2].
